# Groovy Concert Search

## Objective
Our first group required us to develop an idea for a new web applicaiton using a mixture of server-side apis, third-party apis and other programming languages. Our group decided to build a music oriented application that allows users to plan out their next concert trip all from one website. 

## Project Accomplishments
* Used 3 server-side APIs to show users information to plan their trip (Mediawiki API, News API, Ticketmaster API)
* Used 2 third-party APIs to UI enhancement and styling (Moment.js, Particles.js)
* Built an attractive and responsive UI using the Bulma framework and general html
* Worked cohesively as a group and were able to seamlessly integrate all our pieces into a working application
* Met all the project requirements provided by instructors
